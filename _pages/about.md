I'm a full-time researcher at the Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences, where I currently work on developing NLG solutions for Polish language and on stylometry. I'm also a PhD student at the same Institute, focusing on cross-lingual computational stylistics. 

My interests include computational stylistics and discourse analysis, in particular their methodology, factors impacting their performance, and possible application to audiovisual and historical works. My projects involved studying the impact of cleanliness of texts on authorship attribution and usefulness of such files in corpora for linguistics research. I've also been researching authorship of television (=collaborative) works, and will hopefully soon expand this website with more details on that.

I hold BA and MA in English Philology (having proudly written my MA thesis on stylometry in *Doctor Who*) and BSc in Electronic Information Processing (trained to be web dev), split between tech and humanities passions. To meet these interests halfway, since 2016, I've been happily collaborating with [Computational Stylistics Group](https://sites.google.com/site/computationalstylistics/home), both on projects and 'stylo' tutoring sessions.
