I am a full-time researcher at the Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences, in Kraków, where, as of 2025, I work in [CLS Infra](https://clsinfra.io/) Horizon 2020 (g.a. No 101004984) project. In the past, I participated in the [Foundations of Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/focs/) project and [Deep Learning in the Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/deep_learning/) collaboration with University of Antwerp. My research in all of these projects has been dedicated to cross-lingual computational stylistics and advancing stylometric methodology and its understanding, especially locating method limitations and developing evaluation procedures. 

Apart from computational stylistics, I am also interested in discourse analysis and sociolinguistics, especially in connection to translation studies, 'big data' and multimodal perspective. I hold BA and MA in English Philology (having written MA thesis on stylometry of *Doctor Who* dialogue) and BSc in Electronic Information Processing and have also worked as a translator for over a decade. In 2024, I defended my PhD in (computational) linguistics at the Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences. My PhD project built on my research on authorship and style of television works, proposing novel methods of multimodal stylometry for combined analysis of dialogue, image and sound in audiovisual works. I am currently in the process of preparing a book on the topic.

I am a member of [Computational Stylistics Group](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/), with which I've been collaborating since 2016, both on specific research projects and as part of the 'stylo' teaching team. Since then, I have given lectures and conducted workshops in many places around the world, including offering a course on stylometry and computational text analysis at the [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](https://dhsi.org/) six times (2018, 2019, 2024 and 2025 in person, and 2021 and 2022 in an online form). Since 2017, I have also co-organized [Digital Humanities Lunches in Kraków](https://dhlunch.ijppan.pl/en/) - the so far only semi-regular series of lectures on DH issues addressed primarily to Polish audience. 
  
I was deeply engaged in the activities of COST Action [Distant Reading](https://www.distant-reading.net/), especially Working Group 2 "Methods and Tools", which I was honored to formally lead in the years 2020-2022. As part of this, I supported the technical aspects of the development of [ELTeC corpora](https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC), and co-organized two training schools,  [Distant Reading Training School: Named Entity Recognition & Geo-Tagging for Literary Analysis](https://www.distant-reading.net/events/online-named-entity-recognition-geo-tagging-for-literary-analysis-training-school/) and [ Distant Reading Training School: Exploring ELTeC: Use-Cases for Information Extraction and Analysis](https://github.com/distantreading/WG2/tree/master/Exploring_ELTeC_TS). Since spring 2023, I have also held the position of vice-chair of the Steering Committee to the [ADHO Special Interest Group for Digital Literary Studies](https://dls.hypotheses.org/).

On a less academic note, I love learning languages - speaking Polish, English, Spanish and German (as well as bits of some others) - weird music, good (sometimes also weird) TV, and all things gluten. 

While this website is dedicated primarily to my research and teaching activities, you can find more formal information about me - including education and project experience on my Institute [page](https://ijp.pan.pl/en/pracownicy/joanna-byszuk/) (also available in Polish), which is also usually more up to date with publications.
