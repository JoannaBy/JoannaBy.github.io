I'm a full-time researcher at the Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences, where I work in Foundations of Computational Stylistics project. I'm also a PhD student at the same Institute, and my research focuses on cross-lingual computational stylistics and advancing stylometry methodology and its understanding, especially locating method limitations and developing evaluation procedures. 

Apart from computational stylistics my interests include discourse analysis and sociolinguistics. I've been researching authorship of television (=collaborative) works, looking to enhance Distant Reading of audiovisual works. 

I hold BA and MA in English Philology (having written MA thesis on stylometry of *Doctor Who*) and BSc in Electronic Information Processing, sharing tech and humanities passions. I'm a member of [Computational Stylistics Group](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/), with which I've been collaborating since 2016, both on projects and 'stylo' tutoring sessions, and of ADHO SIG in [Digital Literary Stylistics](https://dls.hypotheses.org/).
