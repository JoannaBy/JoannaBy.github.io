I'm a full-time researcher at the Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences, where I work in [Foundations of Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/focs/) project and participate in [Deep Learning in the Computational Stylistics](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/deep_learning/) collaboration with University of Antwerp. I'm also a PhD student at the same Institute, and my research focuses on cross-lingual computational stylistics and advancing stylometry methodology and its understanding, especially locating method limitations and developing evaluation procedures. 

Apart from computational stylistics my interests include discourse analysis and sociolinguistics. For a past couple years, I've been researching authorship of television (=collaborative) works, looking to enhance Distant Reading of audiovisual works. 

I hold BA and MA in English Philology (having written MA thesis on stylometry of *Doctor Who*) and BSc in Electronic Information Processing, sharing tech and humanities passions. I'm a member of [Computational Stylistics Group](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/), with which I've been collaborating since 2016, both on projects and 'stylo' tutoring sessions, and of ADHO SIG in [Digital Literary Stylistics](https://dls.hypotheses.org/).
